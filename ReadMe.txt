A project that revolves around predicting the winner in a League of Legends match depending on the champions picked, first blood, first dragon, baron, tower taken in a game 
(having a better than 51-3% chance of prediction is already better than most analysis)
Whereas from the analysis on the data set im using depending on which features are used we can get from around 53% to 80% depending on the training set used


Prediciton is decided by team comp + fb + ftower + fdragon
